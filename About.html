            Since the initiation of the "OneNYC" strategy in 2015, New York City has been committed to ensuring a sustainable future, with a particular focus on improving air quality. This strategy has driven a series of initiatives, including promoting the adoption of clean energy vehicles, increasing green spaces, and encouraging the use of public transportation and bicycles for commuting. We want to explore the progress made in improving air quality in New York City over the past decade (2011-2021) and the role of policies in driving these improvements. We will demonstrate the relationship between <strong>Air Quality</strong> improvement and the increase in <strong>Green Spaces</strong> , the adoption of <strong>Clean Energy</strong> , and the usage of <strong>Bike Shares</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Through visual charts and data analysis, we will present the following:
            <br><br>
            1. Trends in air quality improvement: By analysing air quality indicators data for New York City, we will showcase the overall trend of air quality improvement over the past decade. These data points will include particle concentrations, air pollutant emissions, and other relevant measures.<br>
            2. Increase in green spaces: We will present the expansion of green spaces in New York City and explore their impact on air quality. Through charts and maps, we will highlight the changes in green coverage and its correlation with air quality improvement.<br>
            3. Promotion of clean energy: We will delve into the growth of clean energy in New York City's energy supply. This will include examining the proportion of clean energy sources such as solar and wind power, as well as their contribution to the green economy, energy mix, and adoption of clean energy vehicles.<br>
            4. Changes in bike sharing system: We will study the trends in bicycle usage in New York City and showcase the development of bicycle infrastructure through visual charts. Furthermore, we will explore the potential impact of increased bicycle usage on air quality.
            <br><br>
            
            Through this web project, our aim is to showcase the impact of sustainable development initiatives in New York City on air quality and provide data-driven visualizations to support this narrative. Our goal is to provide deeper insights into the city's environmental sustainability progress and offer robust evidence for future decision-making processes.
