                    All of the sub-technologies grew between the five years 2016 and 2021, but about half of the overall job growth stemmed from the growth in hybrid electric vehicle employment.

                    Electric vehicle employment is the second largest contributor to job growth in the alternative transportation sector. This is followed by plug-in hybrids, hydrogen and fuel cells, with the least growth in natural gas.

                    This unprecedented job growth coincides with a boom in electric vehicle registration in New York. Original electric vehicle registrations in the State nearly doubled between 2020 and 2021, jumping from about 21,000 in 2020 to about 41,000 in 2021. Of the nearly 41,000 new electric vehicle registrations in 2021, about 23,000 were battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 18,000 were plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

                Electric vehicles (EVs) play an important role in New York City's green economy. The city has implemented policies and incentives to encourage the adoption of EVs as an alternative to conventional gasoline powered vehicles. These include the installation of EV charging stations, tax credits for the purchase of EVs, and the promotion of electric public transportation.
                <br><br>
                By promoting the use of electric vehicles, the city aims to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality and pave the way for a sustainable transport system. The image below shows a map of electric vehicle station locators in New York City, with the different energy sources marked in different colours.
